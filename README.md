# React Electron Example (With No Development Server)

Simple example of using reactjs with electron to create a desktop application. Most examples of this require you to run a lite-server or some other kind of development server to use react. This examples does not require that.

## Installation
```
// Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dbrowne24/react-electron-example
// Change directory
cd react-electron-example
// Install dependencies
npm install
// Run the application
npm start
```

I wanted to keep this example as simple as possible so that it can be used as a quickstart template for any kind of application. If you'd like to see any other features added, feel free to fork this repo and I'll merge your changes if I think they are useful.
